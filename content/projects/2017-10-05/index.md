This was Arcade Game Clone. Provided with visual assets and game loop engine, implemented functionalities in order to play the game. Game was programmed using Object Oriented Javascript programming principles and HTML5 Canvas.

The player can move left, right, up and down
The enemies move at varying speeds on the paved block portion of the game board
Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the starting square
